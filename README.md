PS3: 9.5/10. Check 3b. Note that montecarlo approximation does very well since the true value of E(g(x))=6. Since g is not linear, E(g(x)) is not equal to g(E(x)) and we do not have a direct way to compute the value of E(g(x)). this is one of the reasons when we use montecarlo integration.

Your grades for the problem sets of the first block of the course are:

PS1: 9.75, PS2: 9.75, PS3: 9.5, PS4: 9. Excellent!
